TODO: 
- Checking for the cheapest microphone on sale in any electronic website.
- Storage all microphone prices in one website in a list (or may be better using a dictionary?).
  - _Save name, model, **price**, stock.
- Select one microphone, keep track of its price and send a notification when the price reaches a minimun (most likely a variation of 30%).
  - _Review the price variation, depends on the minimun and maximum discount the website offers._
- Learn ***pyplot*** and ***any matrix-module*** for Python to make data analysis of the prices in time.
- Display data in cool graphs.
